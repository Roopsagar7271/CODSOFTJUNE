**TASK-2**:RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR**
**The password generator project involves creating a Python application that generates strong and random passwords**. Users input the desired password length and complexity. The program then combines random characters to create a password of the specified length. **Finally, the generated password is displayed on the screen for the user to see**. This tool enhances security by producing robust passwords tailored to user preferences.

**TASK3**:ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS GAME
**Create a user-friendly game where the user selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer responds with a random choice. Determine the winner based on the game logic: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. Display the choices and the result, indicating whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie. Optionally, track scores for multiple rounds and offer the option to play again. Design a clear interface with instructions and feedback.**
